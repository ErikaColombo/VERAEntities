# VERA Entities

This version of VERA allow to performe a read-across analysis in two different ways:
1. VERA Alerts, as described in the papers [1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142232) ,[2](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27196605). VERA Alerts assess similarity between chemicals using structural alerts specific to the property, pre-defined molecular groups and structural similarity.
2. VERA Entities. Starting with a unsupervised analysis, VERA Entities analysed several chemical, biotic and abiotic properties indipendently from the endpoint and used this *entities* to provide the assessment.
